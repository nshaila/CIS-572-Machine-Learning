to run:

type in your terminal:

$ python naiveBayes.py training_set.csv test_set.csv beta model.txt

Third argument is beta that takes a float. The output file name is passed as fourth argument. It has the bias and weight of the training data. but for some weird reason its not printing the whole thing. it was printing on terminal correctly.
